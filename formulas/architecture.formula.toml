1. Process compliance — did each step follow its skill? Were human gates respected?
2. Spec quality — did the spec accurately predict implementation needs? Were there surprises?
3. Decomposition effectiveness — were sub-beads well-scoped? Did any need re-scoping?
4. Rationalizations observed — any moments where agents cut corners, skipped checks, or made excuses? Capture exact rationalizations for skill improvement.
5. Cycle efficiency — where did the human wait unnecessarily? Where could polecats have worked in parallel?
6. Skill gaps — did any step lack a skill that would have helped?

⚠️ WARNING: This retro step produces findings. It does NOT authorize acting on them.
All findings MUST be presented at the retro-human gate before implementation.
Do not skip ahead to implementing 'obvious' fixes — that is the agent deciding
which of its own oversight steps to skip, which is the exact failure mode human
gates exist to prevent. See retro-human step.

File ks beads for actionable findings. Link to existing ks issues if the pattern is already tracked.
